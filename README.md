# Getaround EU Backend Challenge (previously Drivy)

## Guidelines

**For each level, write code that creates a new `data/output.json` file from the data in `data/input.json`.
An `expected_output.json` file is available to give you a reference on what result is expected.**

## Pointers

Please note that:

- All prices are stored as integers (in cents)
- Running `$ ruby main.rb` from the level folder must generate the desired output, but of course feel free to add more files if needed.
- Each level contain tests. Before running you need to install rspec `$ gem install rspec` and run tests with command `rspec *_spec.rb` in the level folder.
